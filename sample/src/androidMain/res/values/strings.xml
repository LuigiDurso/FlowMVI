        This feature showcases how you can implement multiplatform business logic and hook it up to a native UI.
        In this case, this activity is implemented using XML, but the store is in the shared module.
        \n\nFlowMVI provides a way to wrap your stores in ViewModels and automatically start/stop them as needed, then inject them
        into your UI components.
        \n\nAs needed, you can even persist the state of a store into a platform-dependent container, i.e. SavedInstanceState
        \nCounter : %d
